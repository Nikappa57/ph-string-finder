# Simple Process Hacker String Finder

This simple string finder was made in March 2020.

It allows you to find strings released by a program in a third-party process using [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io).

**latest version** [**here**](https://github.com/Nikappa57/ph-string-finder-2)

## How to use

*   Clones this repository into a folder.
*   Choose the process in which you want to search for strings.
*   Open processhacker and save the memory strings of the process   
    before and after you started the program, save them in the legit and unlegit folders respectively.  
    (more files means better results, but it will naturally take more time)
*   You can choose whether to save the strings of the actual process and then put them in the CheatProcess (optional)
*   Once you have all your files ready in the respective folders, you can launch the program

```console
python3 run.py
```

*   Select the minimum string length and decide whether to use the CheatProcess
*   Now you’ll just have to wait...
